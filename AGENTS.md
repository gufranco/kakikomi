# kakikomi

Guidance for anyone, human or agent, changing this repository. What kakikomi is and how to use it lives in [README.md](README.md); this file covers how the code is built, tested and shipped.

## Family

kakikomi is one of four tools that share a single command-line contract: [FAMILY.md](FAMILY.md). Help page, options, prompts, output, diagnostics and `doctor` follow it. A change to the contract goes into `FAMILY.md` in all four repositories at once: fusho, kakikomi, kiyome and yakitsuke.

kiyome is the closest sibling. Both keep the same `disk_` function names in [`lib/`](lib), and a fix to a shared helper, such as the option parser in [`lib/cli.sh`](lib/cli.sh) or the drive fault handling in [`lib/io.sh`](lib/io.sh), lands in both repositories.

## Layout

| Path | Holds |
|:-----|:------|
| [`bin/kakikomi`](bin/kakikomi) | The entry point: usage, options, the menu and the write flow |
| [`lib/`](lib) | The modules it sources. [`lib/state.sh`](lib/state.sh) declares every global |
| [`man/kakikomi.1`](man/kakikomi.1) | The man page |
| [`completions/`](completions) | bash, zsh and fish completions |
| [`test/`](test) | The `bats` suite, its helpers and the Linux container script |
| [`scripts/`](scripts) | Coverage, the coverage gate, the name check and the release version stamp |

## Commands

| Command | Does |
|:--------|:-----|
| `make lint` | ShellCheck `-o all` on scripts, tests and the bash completion, mandoc on the man page, and the duplicate-function check |
| `make test` | Every `bats` test under the system `sh` |
| `make test-all` | The same tests under `sh`, `dash`, `bash`, `bash --posix` and `zsh` |
| `make test-linux` | The same tests in a privileged Ubuntu container, where `dmsetup` injects I/O errors |
| `make coverage` | bashcov on this Mac and in the container, merged, gated at 100% |
| `make install` | Installs the tool, man page and completions under `~/.local` |

## Hard rules

- It runs on all five toolsets in [FAMILY.md](FAMILY.md): Linux with GNU coreutils, Linux with uutils coreutils, macOS with the BSD tools it ships, macOS with Homebrew's GNU tools, and macOS with Homebrew's uutils tools. Never use an option one of them lacks; where they differ, handle each one in code and cover it with a test. A change that passes on one toolset only is not done.
- CI runs the suite on every toolset through [`scripts/toolset.sh`](scripts/toolset.sh). To reproduce a report, put the reporter's toolset first: `export PATH="$(sh scripts/toolset.sh gnu | paste -sd: -):$PATH"`.
- `doctor` names the flavor and version of every core tool it lists, such as `gnu 9.7`, `uutils 0.12.0` or `bsd 20200816`. A new core dependency gets a `doctor` row with its flavor in the same change.
- [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) holds only `@AGENTS.md`. Rules for this repository live here, never there.
- A disk is named by its device, such as `/dev/disk4`, or by any volume mounted from it, such as `/Volumes/USB`. Every argument that takes a disk resolves a volume to the whole disk behind it, and the README shows both forms.
- POSIX `sh` only. Every function-scoped variable carries the function's prefix, because `sh` has no `local`.
- No comments in source. Tool directives and the `Arrange`, `Act`, `Assert` markers in tests are the only exceptions.
- Tests write real file-backed disks attached with `hdiutil` or `losetup`. Faults come only from small wrappers placed on `PATH`.
- A new option goes into the help page, the man page and all three completions in the same commit; a test fails otherwise.
- Conventional commits, pushed straight to `main`. No pull requests.

## Release and Homebrew

- Every push to `main` runs semantic-release. A `feat` or `fix` commit publishes a release, stamps `KAKIKOMI_VERSION` in [`lib/core.sh`](lib/core.sh) and updates the CHANGELOG.
- The Homebrew formula is not in this repository. It lives in [gufranco/homebrew-tap](https://github.com/gufranco/homebrew-tap) as `Formula/kakikomi.rb`, next to the formulas for the rest of the family and for other projects.
- After a release, [`.github/workflows/formula.yml`](.github/workflows/formula.yml) sends a `formula-bump` dispatch to the tap with the new tag. The tap rewrites the formula's `url` and `sha256` itself, so neither is edited by hand.
- The dispatch authenticates as a GitHub App through the `TAP_APP_ID` and `TAP_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` secrets of this repository.
- The formula's `install` block decides which files reach users. A new file that must be installed, or a new dependency, needs a matching change to `Formula/kakikomi.rb` in the tap.
- On Linux, the dotfiles install kakikomi from a clone with `make install`.
